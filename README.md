# Artificial-Neural-Networks
This project presents the image classification of hand-written digits from 0 to 9 and also the comparative analysis of traditional neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system is trained using MNIST dataset which consist of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of size (28 x 28 pixels) for each class of 0-9 digit. The system should be trained in such a way that it is able to recognise the hand-written gray-scale input digits.
